# Git Commit

Commit the current staged/unstaged changes with an appropriate commit message.

## Instructions

1. Run `git status` to see what files have changed
2. Run `git diff` to understand the changes
3. Stage only the files that were intentionally modified (do NOT stage untracked files unless they are new files created as part of the work)
4. Write a clear, concise commit message that describes the changes
5. Commit the changes

Use your discretion for the commit message based on the actual changes made.
